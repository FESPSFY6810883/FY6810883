    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Membrane filtration is one of the critical methods in the modern treatment of drinking water, offering solutions to the purification of water, and making it safe for consumption. This paper examines 4 membrane filtration processes: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis. Each of these methods is presented with the capability of what it does: microfiltration and ultrafiltration, larger particles and microorganisms; nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, smaller contaminants like salts, heavy metals, and dissolved organic matter. Applications for such filtration methods are also discussed to outline their applicability in water purification. Also, the challenges regarding membrane fouling and energy requirements with reverse osmosis are discussed. The newest developments that focus on the improvement of membrane materials, and thus on the future possibilities of membrane filtration as a unit operation in providing safe drinking water, will be discussed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Clean drinking water is a basic right of every human being, the quality of which bears immense importance to public health. The technology of water treatment has evolved with time to tackle the rising risks of contamination. Among such methods, membrane filtration has emerged as one of the most effective and widely used methods for purifying drinking water. This technology uses the principle of selective permeability, involving mainly the separation of contaminants from water with the use of membranes based on the size of the particles as well as other properties. Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis—these four big categories serve at different levels in water filtration with each having some unique advantages and limitations. The paper describes these technologies, their use, the challenges, and the novelties which set a trend in modern water treatment systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="types">
    <h2>Types of Membrane Filtration</h2>

    <p><strong>Microfiltration (MF)</strong></p>
    <p>The simple version of filtration using a membrane is microfiltration. It may be regarded as removing larger-sized particles in the water, normally sediments, bacteria, and protozoa, by nature. Pore size on the membranes ranges between 0.1–10 microns, so it acts in a way to filter particles larger in size that cannot pass through. This is a common method used in pre‑treatment for other filtration processes and in water treatment for smaller‑scale applications such as point‑of‑use filtration systems. While microfiltration is effective in removing suspended solids, it does not address dissolved contaminants or smaller microorganisms like viruses (<a href="#ref-schafer2018">Schafer, 2018</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>Ultrafiltration (UF)</strong></p>
    <p>Ultrafiltration membranes have much smaller pore sizes, typically ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 microns, which enable them to filter out even smaller particles, including viruses, bacteria, and larger dissolved organic molecules. Ultrafiltration is also applied in drinking water treatment either as a single‑step process or as part of a multibarrier system in combination with other methods. It is particularly effective for treating surface waters with high microbial contamination, offering a higher degree of purification compared to microfiltration. However, ultrafiltration still cannot remove salts or dissolved inorganic compounds, which are addressed by finer filtration methods such as reverse osmosis (<a href="#ref-hassan2017">Hassan, 2017</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>Nanofiltration (NF)</strong></p>
    <p>Nanofiltration is a membrane filtration process that operates between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. Its pore size normally varies in the range of 0.001 to 0.01 microns, enabling nanofiltration to remove larger divalent ions like calcium and magnesium, as well as organic compounds and pathogens. Nanofiltration is majorly used for water softening and for removing contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides. It is considered an effective alternative to reverse osmosis in certain applications where a balance between removing smaller contaminants and retaining beneficial minerals is desired (<a href="#ref-singh2019">Singh, 2019</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>Reverse Osmosis (RO)</strong></p>
    <p>Reverse osmosis is the most advanced and well‑known technology in membrane filtration. It has a semi‑permeable membrane that removes nearly all the dissolved solids, including salts, heavy metals, and organic contaminants. Reverse osmosis operates at very high pressure and has a pore size of around 0.0001 microns, making it effective for desalinating seawater and treating brackish water. While generally effective, reverse osmosis has its drawbacks in that it is energy‑intensive and prone to membrane fouling, which reduces its overall useful life and efficiency (<a href="#ref-miller2021">Miller, 2021</a>). Recent innovations in membrane materials are geared toward improving permeability while ensuring fouling resistance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="applications">
    <h2>Applications in Drinking Water Treatment</h2>
    <p>Each of the various membrane filtration types has a specific role in drinking water treatment, and most are combined to provide a multi‑barrier system that guarantees water safety. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration usually serve in a pre‑treatment step: they remove larger particles and pathogens, making the water suitable for further purification. Nanofiltration is increasingly used to remove divalent ions responsible for water hardness, while reverse osmosis remains the standard method of desalination and near‑complete removal of dissolved contaminants. In cases where natural freshwater supplies are scarce, reverse osmosis has become a vital part of generating potable water from seawater, otherwise known as desalination, as stated by <a href="#ref-miller2021">Miller (2021)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges and Innovations</h2>
    <p>Membrane fouling is a big problem associated with all membrane filtration technologies. This can be described as the accumulation of contaminants on the membrane surface, thereby reducing filtration efficiency. Consequently, it may increase energy use and operation costs, especially in the case of reverse osmosis. Therefore, new, more robust membranes resistant to fouling are under continuous development. Besides, studies dealing with cleaning techniques, which could prolong the lifetime of the membranes, are also conducted (<a href="#ref-schafer2018">Schafer 2018</a>). There is a high energy demand for reverse osmosis since this is a process that applies high pressure to force the water through the membrane. Recent progress involves innovation in energy recovery systems and the development of new types of membranes that use even less energy, thus further promoting sustainability for large‑scale uses (<a href="#ref-singh2019">Singh 2019</a>).</p>

  <div class="section" id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Membrane filtration is considered a major modern function in the treatment of drinking water due to the variety of methods that can be used for different contaminants. From microfiltration applied for particulate removal to reverse osmosis for desalination, each of the technologies has contributed to the general safety and accessibility of clean drinking water. Though fouling and energy consumption are the main challenges facing this membrane technology, continuous developments in materials and system efficiencies are a promising factor. The future of membrane filtration is one of the more sustainable, cost‑efficient solutions to meet the emergent demand for clean water in a rapidly changing world.</p>
